# File Sorter
Electron app to sort files based on dimensions, bitrate, and other properies. Uses HTML5 templates for dynamic "component" construction, does not use Angular or React in order to keep things as lightweight as possible (and see how hard it is to roll what I need).

Uses:
- Electron 11
- Typescript 4
- SCSS
- Node
